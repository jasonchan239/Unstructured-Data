Interpreting
1) The two differences is MINILM seems to like more links/images and MINILM seems to get context of the phrase better compared to GLOVE, this may be because of MINILM's abiliy to semantic search and higher diemensional vector space.

2) I think that Twitter is not using semantic search, but rather key word search as the returned results mostly contain either the extact phrase or the entire phrase but split up.
